An analog computer is a computer which is used to process analog data. They are particularly useful when you need to measure data directly without converting it to code or number representation first. Analogue computers were used in scientific and industrial applications when there digital counterparts lacked in performance. The main component of the analogue computers that we will be using in this lab is the Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp), which is the essential component of the analogue computer.It is what allows us to solve the various problems we are looking at with relatively simple circuits. The six we are looking at in this lab are, Summer, Differentiator, Integrator, Exponential, Damped Harmonic Oscillator and finally the Force Damped Harmonic Oscillator.
