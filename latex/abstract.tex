For this lab we investigated the analogue computer looking specifically at six circuits that all solved various problems. The first circuit was a summing circuit, we had two input voltages and the output would be the sum of the two circuits. When the data was analyzed we found that it fit well with the theory presented. The next Circuit that we we looked at was the differentiating circuit where we found that it fit well with the theory. We then looked at the integrating circuit, here we found that the output voltage and the calculated voltage were not the same and we attribute it to the slew rate of the op-amp. The next circuit dealt with exponential functions and on this on one we determined that were we found that for some of the data that we obtained the results did not fare well with the theory. Then we made a circuit that would handle damped harmonic motion we were not able to gain a good insight into this circuit due to the data obtained; and finally we looked at forced damped harmonic motion were we found the $Q_{actual} = 1.838$ while the $Q{theory} = 4.01$.
